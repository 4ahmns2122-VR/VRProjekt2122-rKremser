# VR Maze Robin Kremser

### Project description: 
In this game, you are trapped in a maze. In the maze there are dangerous moving spikes which will kill you if you are too slow! Also there is a path, which is blocked by evil elfs. They are dancing to cursed christmas music on a radio. In order to scare them away, you have to throw the radio on the ground, which fixes it. Now that it's playing normal christmas music, the evil elfs run away and you can make your way to freedom.
